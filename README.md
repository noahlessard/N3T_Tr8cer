# N3T_Tr8cer
An ascii styled network scanner, for madhacks 2023!

It works with nmap and python flask, and scans for open ports, registration data, and spam/fraud detection all in one place! 
It also supports searching by open ports, and if you click on the port, it will take you to a list of security vulnerabilites that might be present on that port.


You will need to install the requirements with
> python3 pip install -r requirements.txt

and you will aslo need to install nmap:
> https://nmap.org/download

When you are ready to run the webapp, run web.py and navigate to the link in the command line.

If you want to use the example xml files provided, try scanning 69.128.137.0/24!

Have fun!!
