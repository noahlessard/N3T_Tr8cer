# N3T_Tr8cter
An ascii styled network scanner, for madhacks 2023!

It works with nmap and python flask, and scans for open ports, registrations data, and spam/fraud detection all in one place! 
It also supports searching by open ports, and if you click on the port, it will take you to a list of security vulnerabilites that might be present on that port.


You will need to install the requirements with
> python3 pip install -r requirements.txt

and you will aslo need to install nmap:
> https://nmap.org/download

When you are ready to run the webapp, run web.py and navigate to the link in the command line.

Have fun!!
